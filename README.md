# shell-script-to-download-directory
This repository houses the shell script to download a backup directory from a remote Linux server.
Before running the script you need to create a few directories.
1. Create dir name `backups` in the same directory where the script and key exists.
2. Inside the `backups` directory create three directories name `zipped`, `unzipped` and `new-archive`.
